# Installation

No installation required. Once the files are unpacked from the `.zip ` archive,
software can be used without further delay.

# Usage

Usage is simplified to minimum. Just drag-and-drop your txt data file on the
validator application file, and the validation process launches. After
validation report press *enter* to finish.

# Parameters

Application can be also used from command line.

1. **Input path** - must point to the file with data to validate.
2. **--nonblocking** - if specified, program will exit without waiting for
confirmation.

# Final notes
